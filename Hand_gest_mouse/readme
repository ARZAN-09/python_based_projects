# Hand Gesture Mouse Control 🖐️🖱️

This project lets you control your computer mouse using just your "hand gestures"
through your webcam. It uses "OpenCV", "MediaPipe", and "PyAutoGUI" 
to track your hand in real-time and turn gestures into actions like moving the cursor, clicking, and scrolling.

## ✨ Features

* Real-time "hand tracking" using your webcam.
* Move your mouse by moving your "index finger".
* **Pinch (thumb + index)** to click.
* Optional "scroll mode" using a two-finger gesture.
* Toggle between modes (Mirror / Gesture Overlay / Scroll / Click).
* On-screen UI panel showing FPS, status, and active modes.

## 🖐️ Gestures

* "Move Cursor" → Move your index finger.

* Works best in good lighting.
* Keep your hand in front of the webcam, slightly away for accuracy.
* You may need to adjust sensitivity thresholds in the code for your system.
